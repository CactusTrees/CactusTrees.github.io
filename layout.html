      <b>CactusTree</b> is a novel visualization technique for representing the structure and connectivity in deeply nested trees. <b>CactusTree</b> was inspired by our ongoing work in creating biological pathway visualizations that enable a range of different visual analytics tasks. Although biological pathways can be thought of as interconnected graph structures, domain experts tend to carve out particular subgraphs of pathways in order to limit their complexity and to focus on the components that are relevant to a particular research problem. For the most part, the representations of these pathways are hierarchical structures.<br></li>

    <li style="margin-left: 30px">
      An important consideration in visualizing biological pathways is clearly showing how particular biological elements influence or are influenced by other elements. That is, it can be necessary to highlight relevant interconnected sub-trees with a particular directionality, while at the same time making sure not to obscure the hierarchical information in the tree. <br></li>

    <li style="margin-left: 30px">
      <b>CactusTree</b> visualization technique is geared specifically towards more effectively representing  overlaid bundles of intersecting links between nodes in the tree. This is a noteworthy approach toward solving the problem of collinearity that was observed in the original paper on hierarchical edge bundling (see Fig. 17 in 
    <a href="http://www.aviz.fr/wiki/uploads/Teaching2014/bundles_infovis.pdf">Hierarchical Edge Bundling</a> paper). Rather than investigating the bundling techniques themselves, as most existing approaches have attempted, here we have explored the potential of modifying to the underlying tree layout. <br></li>

      The following figures show CactusTree visualization technique for the <i>Activation of Pro-caspase 8</i> and <a href="http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#/R-HSA-1227986"><i>ERBB2</i></a>  pathway. Blue (leaf) nodes are biochemical reactions within this pathway. Gray nodes are sub-pathways which are stacked directly on the top of parent pathway. We use red links to indicate the causal relationships between nodes (biochemical reactions). Connections of nodes in different sub-trees are wired (bundled) through the center of their closest common ancestor. <br>

      During the course, students will get hands-on experiences on building interactive visualizations for various real-world datasets. Students will be accessed their learnings through three visualization projects.
